# MalwareClassification

Classify malware into families based on file content and characteristics based on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge(2015)

Since, GitHub shows some issues with the ipynb notebook. You can still view it in nbviewer:
Copy the link https://github.com/nandan002/MalwareClassification/blob/main/Microsoft_malware.ipynb.

open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" and paste the notebook link.

For each file, the raw data contains the hexadecimal representation of the file's binary content, without the PE header (to ensure sterility).  
And a metadata manifest, which is a log containing various metadata information extracted from the binary, such as function calls, strings, etc.(ASM Files)

Main Features:
Unigram features from byte files and storing in a csv file.
Bigram features from byte files
Size of the byte files

and then, selecting the top 2000 features for faster computation

Unigram features from .asm files
Converting the content of the .asm files into Image and considered the first 800 features

Model:
Used XGBoost Classifier model to predict the classifier as it should better results than RandomForest
